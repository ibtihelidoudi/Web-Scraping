# Web Scraping Project

## Overview
This project focuses on extracting job listing data from the Indeed website, specifically for job titles such as "consultant", "engineer", and "analyst". The purpose is to provide valuable insights into job market trends, salary variations, and skill demands. The project involves web scraping using Python and several libraries, including Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.

## Main Concepts

### What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is the automated process of extracting large amounts of data from websites. It involves using software tools or scripts to access web pages and retrieve specific unstructured data, which is then saved in a structured format for further analysis or use.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for web scraping.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Library for parsing HTML and extracting data.
- **Selenium**: Browser automation tool for dynamic content scraping.
- **Pandas**: For storing and analyzing extracted data.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Project Workflow

1. **Planning & Scope Definition**: Define the goal (extract job listings from Indeed) and scope (job titles, company names, locations, etc.).
2. **Data Extraction**: Use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape job data from multiple pages on the Indeed website.
3. **Data Storage**: Save extracted data in CSV format for further analysis.
4. **Data Processing**: Clean, filter, and transform the data.
5. **Data Analysis**: Analyze trends in job market demands and visualize findings.

## Results
The analysis showed a high demand for engineers, followed by analysts and consultants. The demand for business, data, and financial analysts was prominent, and in consultancy, travel consultants were most sought after.
